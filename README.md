## Overview

DeepBucketLab is an interactive, hands-on tool designed to introduce students in civil engineering and Earth science disciplines to the fundamentals of neural network-based modeling, with a specific focus on hydrological processes. As neural networks become increasingly vital in predicting current and future hydrological conditions, there's a growing need for formal education in this area at the upper division and graduate levels. DeepBucketLab aims to fill this gap by providing a practical and educational platform for training effective neural network models for hydrological prediction.
