	abstract = {Theme
The effective conservation and management of our natural resources depends upon education and communication. The theme of the National Park Service Interpretation and Education Division is ``connecting people to parks.'' This theme centers on creating unique and powerful learning experiences that increase understanding and inspire personal values. Recent technological and internet advances have allowed scientists to communicate complex and dynamic ecological processes more easily and to broader audiences than ever before. Our applied, interdisciplinary approach for communicating ecological knowledge links science, management, and policy through a visualization‐based integration of climate, landscape, animal data, and humanity in the central Yellowstone ecosystem. We developed visualization products that enable students and the public to explore and understand ecological patterns and relationships in Yellowstone National Park. By integrating these visualization products with innovative pedagogy and web technology, we hope to engage and excite a broader audience in the ecological research and natural resource management issues of the central Yellowstone ecosystem. We illustrate this approach by presenting a diverse set of educational and outreach products, including: (1) a simple, web‐based ``Data Mapper'' visualization tool; (2) an undergraduate education module; (3) a series of informal education ``Virtual Interpretive Trail'' visualizations; (4) a variety of data mapping and analysis services; and (5) a decision‐support tool for resource managers.},

@article{Addor2017,
   abstract = {We present a new data set of attributes for 671 catchments in the contiguous United States (CONUS) min-imally impacted by human activities. This complements the daily time series of meteorological forcing and streamflow provided by Newman et al. (2015b). To produce this exten-sion, we synthesized diverse and complementary data sets to describe six main classes of attributes at the catchment scale: topography, climate, streamflow, land cover, soil, and geol-ogy. The spatial variations among basins over the CONUS are discussed and compared using a series of maps. The large number of catchments, combined with the diversity of the attributes we extracted, makes this new data set well suited for large-sample studies and comparative hydrology. In com-parison to the similar Model Parameter Estimation Experi-ment (MOPEX) data set, this data set relies on more recent data, it covers a wider range of attributes, and its catchments are more evenly distributed across the CONUS. This study also involves assessments of the limitations of the source data sets used to compute catchment attributes, as well as detailed descriptions of how the attributes were computed. The hydrometeorological time series provided by New-man et al. (2015b, https://doi.org/10.5065/D6MW2F4D) to-gether with the catchment attributes introduced in this paper (https://doi.org/10.5065/D6G73C3Q) constitute the freely available CAMELS data set, which stands for Catchment At-tributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies.},

abstract = {Abstract Hydrology has advanced considerably as a scientific discipline since its recognized inception in the mid-twentieth century. Modern water resource related questions have forced adaptation from exclusively physical or engineering science viewpoints toward a deliberate interdisciplinary context. Over the past few decades, many of the eventual manifestations of this evolution were foreseen by prominent expert hydrologists. However, their narrative descriptions have lacked substantial quantification. This study addressed that gap by measuring the prevalence of and analyzing the relationships between the terms most frequently used by hydrologists to define and describe their research. We analyzed 16,591 journal article titles from 1965–2015 in Water Resources Research, through which the scientific dialogue and its time-sensitive progression emerged. Our word frequency and term cooccurrence network results revealed the dynamic timing of the lateral movement of hydrology across multiple disciplines as well as the deepening of scientific discourse with respect to traditional hydrologic questions. The conversation among water resource scientists surrounding the hydrologic subdisciplines of catchment-hydrology, hydro-meteorology, socio-hydrology, hydro-climatology, and eco-hydrology gained statistically significant momentum in the analyzed time period, while that of hydro-geology and contaminant-hydrology experienced periods of increase followed by significant decline. This study concludes that formerly exotic disciplines can potentially modify hydrology, prompting new insights and inspiring unconventional perspectives on old questions that may have otherwise become obsolete.},
